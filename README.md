# SimpleCPU Implementation with VHDL and Quartus

Welcome to the SimpleCPU repository! This project focuses on implementing a basic Central Processing Unit (CPU) using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) within the Quartus environment. The SimpleCPU is designed to provide a foundational understanding of CPU architecture and digital logic design, making it suitable for educational purposes and small-scale embedded systems.

## Overview

The SimpleCPU implementation in VHDL leverages Quartus, a popular software tool for designing and simulating digital circuits, to create a functional CPU architecture. The project includes modules for the CPU core, instruction set architecture (ISA), control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and memory interface. By combining these modules and defining the CPU's behavior in VHDL, developers can simulate and synthesize a basic CPU design suitable for various applications.

## Features

### 1. CPU Core

The SimpleCPU features a basic CPU core that executes instructions fetched from memory. The CPU core includes components such as instruction decoding, register file, program counter, and data path for executing arithmetic and logic operations.

### 2. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The CPU supports a simple instruction set architecture (ISA) comprising a limited set of instructions for data manipulation, control flow, and memory access. The ISA defines the operation codes (opcodes) and operand formats used by the CPU to execute instructions.

### 3. Control Unit

The control unit is responsible for coordinating the execution of instructions within the CPU. It generates control signals based on the current instruction and CPU state, ensuring proper sequencing of operations and data flow through the CPU pipeline.

### 4. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations on data operands fetched from registers or memory. It supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR, and comparison, enabling computation of arithmetic expressions and logical conditions.

### 5. Memory Interface

The CPU includes a memory interface for accessing data and instructions stored in external memory devices. The memory interface manages memory address decoding, read/write operations, and data bus communication, allowing the CPU to interact with memory seamlessly.

## Usage

To use the SimpleCPU implemented with VHDL and Quartus, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up the Quartus environment on your computer. Install the necessary software packages and configure the development environment according to the provided instructions.

3. Open the SimpleCPU project in Quartus and review the VHDL source code files comprising the CPU design. Familiarize yourself with the architecture, components, and interconnections of the CPU modules.

4. Compile the VHDL source code and perform functional simulations to verify the correctness of the CPU design. Use simulation tools provided by Quartus to observe CPU behavior, execute test programs, and debug potential issues.

5. Synthesize the CPU design to generate a hardware description file (e.g., .vhd or .v) suitable for implementation on FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) or ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) platforms. Follow the synthesis and implementation process outlined in the Quartus documentation.

6. Deploy the synthesized CPU design onto the target hardware platform (e.g., FPGA development board) for testing and evaluation. Verify the functionality of the CPU in a real-world environment and assess its performance for specific applications.
